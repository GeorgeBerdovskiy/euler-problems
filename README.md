# euler-problems
This repository is a collection of my solutions to the first one hundred Project Euler challenges. Please don't spoil your fun by looking for solutions before you are ready!

## Folder Organization
The parent folder contains the C++ files for every challenge. The number of each file is the challenge it solves.

Executable versions of these files are located in the `executables` folder.

## Compiling and Running
Anybody running Mac OS X (or Linux) can easily run any of these solutions by typing `./execute [NAME OF FILE]` into the terminal. The `execute` program will compile the source code of the specified file, create an executable file in the executables folder, and run it automatically.
